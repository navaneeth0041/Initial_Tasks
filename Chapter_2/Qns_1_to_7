1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ans, 
	The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False. They are case-sensitive and so they written in the form that the first letter is capitalized.

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
ans, 
	Boolean operators are used to compare Boolean values(They will evaluate the expressions down to a Boolean value).

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
ans, 
	Boolean operator: and

	True and True		True
	True and False		False
	False and True		False
	False and False		False


	Boolean operator: or

	True or True		True
	True or False		True
	False or True		True
	False or False		False


	Boolean operator: not

	not True			False
	not False			True


4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
ans,
	(5 > 4) and (3 ==5) will evaluate to False

	not (5>4) will evaluate to False

	(5>4) or (3==5) will evaluate to True

	not ((5>4)) or (3==5)) will evaluate to False

	(not False) or (not True) will evaluate to True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
ans,
	The six assignment operators are =, >, <, !=, <= and >=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
ans,
	 The equal to operator is used for the comparison of two values while the assignment operator is used to store a value in a user given variable.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
ans,
	Condition is a expression used in the code which evaluates to a Boolean value.
