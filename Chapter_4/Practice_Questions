	It is an empty list

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
ans,
	spam[2]='hello'

3.  What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
ans,
	'd'

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
ans,
	'd'

ans,
	['a','b']

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
ans,
	1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
ans,
	[3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True,99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
ans,
	[3.14, 11, 'cat',True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
ans,
	+ and * respectively

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
ans,
	While using append a item is added to the end of the list while using insert we can insert at a particular index.

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
ans,
	pop(),del,remove()

12.  Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
ans,
	Both can be accessed using index, they can be used inside a for loop and both can be concatanated.

13.  What is the difference between lists and tuples?
ans,
	List is mutable while tuple is immutable which means that tuples can't be changed.

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
ans,
	(42,)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
ans,
	tuple(list_name) and list(tuple_name)

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
ans,


17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
ans,
	copy.deepcopy() function will copy the inner list, while the copy.copy don't.
